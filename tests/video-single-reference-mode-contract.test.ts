// #157 asked to let the user CHOOSE between animating the image and using it as a guide,
// and forcing the reference slot just replaced one fixed answer with another — it also
// removed the only way to reach image-to-video from the composer.
//
// The contract this pins now: one attachment is the user's choice, defaulting to the
// pre-v3.8.0 behavior; two or more can only be references.
