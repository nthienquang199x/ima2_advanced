// Source-level contract test for the startup ghost-video regression.
//
// Two independent causes produced a "data-less video" at ima2 startup:
//
// 1. tests/cli-video-command-contract.test.js spawned the real CLI without an
//    isolated ima2 home, so default (no --out/--out-dir) video downloads fell
//    back to config.storage.generatedDir and wrote a 3-byte mock `out.mp4`
//    into the REAL ~/.ima2/generated. The history directory scan
//    (lib/historyList.ts) then listed it forever as a metadata-less video.
//
// 2. toPersistedInFlightJob() (ui/src/store/storeHelpers.ts) dropped the
//    server's `kind: "video"` because "video" was missing from its allowlist.
//    The job persisted to localStorage as kind:undefined, was treated as
//    "classic", fell out of the node+video polling scope after a restart, and
//    survived as an unremovable ghost inflight spinner.
