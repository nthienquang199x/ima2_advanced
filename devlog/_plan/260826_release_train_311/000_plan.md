# 000 — Release train 3.11.0: devlog cleanup + release

## Objective

Archive completed devlog units, update docs, push dev, merge to main, and cut
v3.11.0 stable release.

## Work-phase map

| WP | Slice |
|----|-------|
| wp0 | devlog triage + _fin migration + README/structure update |
| wp1 | gates + push dev + dev→main PR + merge |
| wp2 | release.yml dispatch + npm stable verification |

## Evidence

- dev has 11 commits ahead of origin/main (10 NovelAI + 1 devlog cleanup)
